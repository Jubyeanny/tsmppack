The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-06-16T23:27:59.452464Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":5879143,"followers":6438,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7","VlLxDisa","XPsoVC5n","w4F7PG0f"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"w4F7PG0f","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.33 for Minecraft 1.21.x/Sodium 0.5.9","version_number":"1.0.33+mc1.21","changelog":"- Fix glint rendering issue (Indigo PR port) (comp500)\n- Add issue template (comp500)\n- Bump version (comp500)\n- Update to Sodium 0.5.9 (comp500)\n- Update Java version in Github Actions (comp500)\n- Initial port to 1.21 (builds, untested) (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.33+mc1.21","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-16T23:28:00.819662Z","downloads":106949,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1ad1ca78d1185b4f702def3a0feab7bef7d943d5","sha512":"b731daebb4dbd573e8fceff0f2039c0b43ed61abc6d772f9d382f93cc27f036a7e6912ee9d22f09602d556331bea9a4729f821eed05301a2718520ab238edcf3"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/w4F7PG0f/indium-1.0.33%2Bmc1.21.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.33+mc1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":104920,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"dNHeFokL","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.33+mc1.21.jar"},"mods\\architectury-13.0.1-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"165b4dc86cbf22853795104711c4236dfceb92aac1afb9dc57aa4b9618685ce3eb9326cb518cc6f7ba7bbae921682f676ba6762fb708958c8b2ea6028f82e81b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"lhGA9TYQ","slug":"architectury-api","project_type":"mod","team":"72qgsq9X","title":"Architectury API","description":"An intermediary api aimed to ease developing multiplatform mods.","body":"# Architectury API\n\nTalk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/C2RdJDpRBP)!\n\nAn intermediary api aimed to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury

Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-06-17T08:24:45.317893Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2083305,"followers":1951,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K","GUHZDxpy","9IcJV4UJ","dUVBjrNs","ylmBQ38A"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"ylmBQ38A","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.21 Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.26","version_number":"1.21-2.26-fabric","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.21.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-17T08:24:47.086399Z","downloads":21643,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ee81af33a5606ef2cd057e075833d7c69836c210","sha512":"1744a48a47aedcbf19a0a93f78473cf0221fc4782852dca7fc02685719174664b4f9d95d353fcfc16902ac3815594511ba6d9ab14391f9b7e25ec9b2e777927a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/ylmBQ38A/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.21-2.26.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.21-2.26.jar","primary":true,"size":75984,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"e4edaff414f34f397a25c18c7a578bc88249d494","sha512":"643d0e77709ccfd4c22a37f1ced073834cce3261af52bff09fd53832a9eb5dcbb276be18300e1a66fe22a0f517f7d3220e40fca88f6c3ce5afcbeb771a0c2e5d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/ylmBQ38A/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.21-2.26-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.21-2.26-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65179,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.21-2.26.jar"},"mods\\bookcopy-0.1.1-1.21.jar":{"sha512":"418e8373471e4a8cda79bfdc7dca6e02b59a6dbc1e4c3823f973a42e1b90c1f4d9aef3f0d3dd994279f819f78895187b0293a0b08aee9f36b41ea3d020cd6afd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"jkOtP64i","slug":"book-copy","project_type":"mod","team":"Wsz0qFGk","title":"Book Copy","description":"This mod adds a simple client-side /bookcopy command, which allows you to save written books and import them later in another book.","body":"# Book Copy\n\n![Modrinth Version](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/v/jkOtP64i?logo=modrinth&color=008800)\n![Modrinth Game Versions](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/game-versions/jkOtP64i?logo=modrinth&color=008800)\n![Modrinth Downloads](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/jkOtP64i?logo=modrinth&color=008800)\n\nThis mod adds a simple client-side `/bookcopy` command, which allows you to save written books and\nimport them later in another book.\n\nFeel free to report any bugs, or suggest new features, at the issue tracker.\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is licensed under GNU GPLv3.\n\n## Usage\n\nThis mod is currently available for Minecraft 1.21, 1.20.5+6/1.20.4 (no longer updated) and 1.20.1 with Fabric loader 0.15.11 or later.\nVersion port requests can be made at the issue tracker.

you would like to show a token of your appreciation for my work, and help support the development of Sodium in the process, then consider [buying me a coffee](https://jellysquid.me/donate).\n\n<a

quality. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-06-13T21:09:50.372921Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":12669685,"followers":14172,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d","qhg37WBD","dNHeFokL","QHGZ9XSU","dEpHs0Hg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"dNHeFokL","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"DzLrfrbK","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.9","version_number":"mc1.21-0.5.9","changelog":"This is a minor bugfix release to fix some driver and mod compatibility issues, as well as updating to Minecraft 1.21.\n\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-13T15:38:15.755886Z","downloads":345278,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3b1ad241af59c32f6ed016c8a285429bfb5c5f86","sha512":"709dfe4c504ba134cc24612dd931732eb728e04888f3f751083fc5a6eae6584111c194d37a11a9856ef04203e52c8c01845ec75fec12df2daab069feba2ebec6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/versions/dNHeFokL/sodium-fabric-0.5.9%2Bmc1.21.jar","filename":"sodium-fabric-0.5.9+mc1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":979834,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4reLOAKe","user":{"id":"DzLrfrbK","username":"IMS","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31803019?v=4","bio":"the Iris guy","created":"2020-12-01T00:40:02.137876Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"4reLOAKe","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":"JellySquid","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TEZXhE2U/f4705a5f2388c65029ae2e59f1434b3e6e4de23a.png","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sodium-fabric-0.5.9+mc1.21.jar"},"mods\\Slideshow-fabric-1.21-1.0.3-Enhancement-1.jar":{"sha512":"f7b63e6cbb0c79b0d375450e3044e9477fce36b2bb3b800ac29559efa0d004ffa3afb96ea5499b3878f76fbd9cb5e5f025afab1b89a2e42a335892e455a40b5b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"CvIO1eYD","slug":"slideshow-fabric","project_type":"mod","team":"KHPjujon","title":"Slideshow(Fabric)","description":"a Minecraft mod that adds a \"Slide Show Projector\" block.

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-06-20T12:20:10.721384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":7630924,"followers":9921,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF","g2qXxjsR","fsK2ycFx","OC4JOVBe","my7uONjU","p25IJhj0","5a3sPIH2"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"OC4JOVBe","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.12.5","version_number":"mc1.21-0.12.5","changelog":"Lithium 0.12.5 is the first release for 1.21.

Extensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-trims-extensions)\n\n## Installation\n\nElytra Trims has to be installed on the client to be able to see trims and other features.  \nInstalling it on a server enables new trimming and crafting recipes. It doesn't require all players to have the mod, but in that case they won't see the trims/dyes/etc.\n\nYou can *technically* obtain a trimmed/dyed elytra on a server without the mod. To do it create an elytra you want in creative singleplayer, save it in a hotbar and load on the server.\n\n## Trims\n\nPut any trim on your elytra just like any other armor. Mod provides a default resourcepack with all vanilla trims, but\nit can be expanded further.\n\n![A few trims](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/6e8e22627a57ea58dec99c451c7e7595faf0c5a0.png)\n\n## Banner patterns\n\nCombine your elytra with a banner to add intricate patterns and designs to your elytra.\n\n![Elytra with banner patterns](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/0327378aa65018c5f4e761c09c14fa94bb7e1d8d.png)\n\n## Dyeing\n\nIf you fancy something simplistic, dye your elytra however you want in a crafting table.\n\n![Dyed elytra](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/511e985762a518992f2bc140b34e9f5c104ade74.png)\n\n## Glowing\n\nCraft your elytra with a glow ink sac to make it glow in the dark.\n\n![Glowing trim](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/images/849d54736e4519df78678bf00a2077a528e866ad.png)\n\n## Mod compatibility\nThis lists mods Elytra Trims has explicit support for or known to work with. \nIt's likely to work with other mods, but you'll have to try it out.\n\n### Supports\n- Custom elytras:\n  - [Mythic Metals](https://modrinth.com/mod/mythicmetals)\n  - [Better End](https://modrinth.com/mod/betterend)\n  - [Mekanism](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism)\n- Extra trim patterns (Requires [Extensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-trims-extensions): \n  - [More Armor Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-armor-trims)\n  - [Geode+](https://modrinth.com/mod/geode-plus)\n  - [Frostiful](https://modrinth.com/mod/frostiful)\n  - [Ancient Aether](https://modrinth.com/mod/ancient-aether)\n  - [Alex's Caves](https://modrinth.com/mod/alexs-caves)\n- Elytra trinkets:\n  - [Elytra Slot](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra-slot)\n  - [Elytra Trinket](https://modrinth.com/mod/elytra_trinket)\n- Trim utilities:\n  - [All The Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/allthetrims)\n  - [Better Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/bettertrims)\n  - [Better Enchanting Table](https://modrinth.com/mod/bettersmithingtable)\n- Extra banners:\n  - [Additional Banners](https://modrinth.com/mod/additional-banners)\n  - [Archeology Banners](https://modrinth.com/mod/archaeology-banners)\n  - *And any other banner mods*\n\n### Conflicts\n- [Customizable Elytra](<https://modrinth.com/mod/customizable-elytra>) - overrides elytra renderer entirely, preventing Elytra Trims from working.\n\n## Customization\n\nWith resourcepack support, you can customize all the mod's features to your liking. Change the texture of your armor\ntrims or add a unique design to your elytra pattern with ease.\n\n## FAQ\n(Elytra Trims will be referred as ET)\n> I can't put trims/banner/dyes on the elytra!\n- If you're playing on a server, ET has to be installed there. On a paper/purpur/spigot or vanilla server you can use the datapack, but it will only work for trims.\n  If you're playing in singleplayer, it means ET is not loaded. Look up on YouTube how to install mods.\n\n> How do I use this mod on a server without it?\n- Client-side commands are planned, however for now the easiest way is to save trimmed elytra in a creative hotbar and load it on a server.  \n  Survival recipes are not possible without the mod installed on the server.\n\n> How can I remove trims/patterns/dye/glow from my elytra?\n- To remove patterns, dye and glow (all together), click with elytra on a cauldrow with water.  \nTrims can't be removed without other mods due to vanilla parity.\n\n> Trims look bad with capes!\n- Install [Mod Menu](<https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu>) and [YACL](<https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl>). In the mods tab find ET and open its settings. There you can disable rendering elytra capes. This is preferable to the vanilla cape setting because it will keep the cape while not wearing an elytra.\n\n## Roadmap\n- [x] Elytra trims (v1.0)\n- [x] Dyes and banners (v1.1.0)\n- [x] [YACL](<https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl>) support (v1.1.1)\n- [x] Multiversion build (v1.1.2)\n- [x] Glowing elytras (v1.1.4)\n- [x] Elytra cleaning (v1.1.4)\n- [x] Smithing table preview (v1.1.7)\n- [x] Runtime trim generation (v1.1.10)\n- [x] Runtime banner generation (v1.3.0)\n- [x] HD banner support (v1.3.0)\n- [x] 🐸 support (I'll regret this) (v2.0)\n- [x] Server-side config (v2.0)\n### TODO\n- [ ] Banner pattern preview\n- [ ] Modernfix dynamic resources support\n- [ ] Elytra glow preview\n","published":"2023-04-17T21:39:25.825695Z","updated":"2024-06-15T11:48:30.695774Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":492417,"followers":543,"categories":["decoration","equipment"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre4","1.20","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","1.20.2","23w42a","23w45a","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["7va3yOBQ","9TQnMw0W","JtH7CecY","gL8hZ6Xj","5yKVxto5","inc4Dcth","mwodRBWG","SOu4NhdV","R7A2RmNK","M8oA6gim","jElDTAm0","kyavYZlv","7WK5Kp1U","uF1aFX3B","GNJJPxjN","MggVxdpI","ypc5CuaH","HJTg637z","AMxoQ54e","ItisH5nP","LS3AbvH7","z0hix6ft","rTZwqueT","wmtpMrnl","EQzECFBm","ieLJPquL","FXH92A6K","bTCDAo8N","PIcktN29","bR0BfcUH","RdFl4K9L","NiwgXpQZ","ymm44PMX","OnEnlw0n","9sSumTBc","agclFP3W","8iWiQ5Nn","9BEwx7wg","hE1gM9oN","BvemApH8","iNTnYl5N","xP4Gl1b0","vAgQHF1X","B4PnSTQu","laqf3DSe","oNITsVCz","1iryHhRb","ymNEFvRO","QRL5y6QQ","uKJ1JMgM","pRDQnZ3Y","VQvpXYIw","cNldVpfM","GgqWN3lN","NHXd6aZk","eA3xjW1D","L0nFypDE","Cw7vQBik","UftAzqfE","5XZ3UEKw","Ooz6Jx4o","EliLN0ix","OMDXx6OH","pctsHeqv","o6nVTLWj","4CfujfbP","4MRafQSS","fktTheEn","MOh7QLA3","zWp19pgU","iQklebfQ","arD5Xqc8","eIya0oNP","JvpIRp5B","YCgd5pGr","ndRFSXYs","X4ycErBs","NEJZCAYP","BAwtNPbV","48Jae3NW","is02SVOE","RpYgituO","xDislzdN","Tye2YulM","A3BCJ4tn","wIaZkgnn","9WaYGCAa","QfSL9w6K","GJuN0S4O","eLitxo2m","AsnDKXYq","5HxqNByi","sSXZ1cV2","J86kArKC","DI0DbeTE","tW7ec5at","JPsYNJL8","abvxH5cO","PEVkdm6b","Ouu7QmnI","OPHjNzZr","DTlDDoEA","9RT9DAyf","WdHJ6m9J","ttfz5wz1","EOBfm4qQ","MPlCfC6V","NMLPFJLt","nD7vQ1Rh","U0TruPGS","e5TXIhrR","VND82JZu","jHQIMj34","yLPvzd4Y","9QqdGuvX","n4JFZghf","FmJOHJFO","JxtAySBt","rZKT4NSD","uQWerL02","17JClTpn","lGwq4Gfj","DPPSPf1h","Wp0Addzk","3gqfymU7","6prIYTKd","9hsVtQPw","ShgdxBtp","9MAdrSrU","b8ns7J4y","5rzis546","kXZj7coD","Zxik31rP","LikyuVpI","DjxSyAqI","6t2XFT0t","v5fZhgho","j846aDeu","TihNhTip","hSQvnRJQ","pt2zv8yw","zQJCQHUN","2Mk4361S","UGPjqjrr","CGwW9wKC","yjhRG3hp","73ndfQBm","hf0Fd7Cx","4GGj9HbQ","D6qEAdIq","p3wM0Kc8","kGxu6GZ3","C8aqXhYo","BwROnI5B","XiH6sJZv","hlgFfdga","MZWRUIiG","kXdYNs1n","86sgVa5G","OM0QvjKn","8EVhThwE","9X8KqlRu","Mx7FuBvI","rzDs8WE3","xCDYkkmH","KwXOYawn","pEfyihU0","sO340cek","BnDwQ7ki","IOxj8VWJ","dUDEzKit","oojMYNTb","RdM9X8Ug","TGI7RXJy","lV3nUi8H","cmwGwY3i","M6Umk1nn","dzEgG5ow","R1PZECX0","s66ey95p","QAbVpcvs","RsehavBl","nI4En1F0","CYnOLoVM","Xf2EqIR3","mu1NXewR","QtH0wazk","kIstVNaS","JYWfcB0a","99Vsfseo","IcrCGf5x","RC1sbYLv","UwCj3o2F","7TqVzKL9","AaxuZxCi","Nb2vgSKe","nWkaFmxL","bhteMbY4","BgLzQbAt","jOl0IwON","vUN3uyzB","PFDO05xr","g2AqadoV","nQhzL5W7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XpzGz7KD/8ff6751948e096f540e320681742d0b3b918931e.png"},"version":{"id":"BgLzQbAt","project_id":"XpzGz7KD","author_id":"OwD8VUqB","featured":false,"name":"Elytra Trims Fabric 3.2.0 for 1.21","version_number":"3.2.0","changelog":"## Changes\r\n- Updated to 1.21. *This (again) required big code changes, so if anything breaks, open an issue report.*\r\n- Several trim textures have been reworked - Vex, Wild, Wayfinder, Raiser, Shaper, Spire and some minor tweaks to other textures.

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight.

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very heavy shaders).\nSlower CPUs will benefit more from this mod than really fast CPUs.\n\n### Entity Rendering\nGenerally FPS should be around **2x higher** on busy servers.

A list of the contents can be found in [this file](https://github.com/SolidBlock-cn/extshape/blob/1.20.4/BlockList.md).\n\nAt present this mod supports Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.4-1.16.5. Please install the relevant mod according to your MC version, and it requires Fabric API and BRRP. Besides, for Fabric, Mod Menu is usually needed (but not required) to open mod config screen.\n\n**Notice: The mod requires BRRP (Better Runtime Resource Pack) to run.**\n\nIf you have installed Extended Block Shapes and Blockus, you may also optionally install [Extended Block Shapes - Blockus](#Blockus), to add inter-mod support for Blockus.\n\nSee [update log](https://github.com/SolidBlock-cn/extshape/blob/1.19/UpdateLog.md) for previous update logs. Welcome to join Tencent QQ group **587928350** or KOOK (KaiHeiLa) channel invitation code **KlFS0n** to experience the latest update of this mod.\n\n## Features\n\n### Blocks\n\nThis mod provides amounts of variants of many blocks. For example, wool has wool stairs, wool slab, wool wall, wool pressure plate, etc. Vertical stairs, vertical slab, quarter piece and vertical quarter piece are added by the mod; these blocks, like regular stairs and slabs, are waterloggable.\n\nThe hardness, mining tools and mining time of all stairs, slabs, fences and walls are equal to their base blocks, which is the same behaviour of vanilla, instead of related to their volume. For example, a plank slab and a plank block will take the same time to mine.\n\nIn vanilla, the hardness of pressure plates and buttons equals to 1/4 or 1/3 of their basic blocks. All pressure plates and buttons added in this mod have the same hardness as 1/4 of their base blocks. This mod simply extends buttons: soft buttons (wool buttons, snow buttons) trigger 60 ticks (3 seconds); hard buttons (obsidian buttons, bedrock buttons) trigger 5 ticks (1/4 second). For the actual activation time, see the table below. Like in vanilla Minecraft, all buttons and pressure plates have no collision box.\n\n| base block                              | button activation time | plate activation time |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| stone blocks                            | 20                     | 20                    |\n| wooden and bamboo                       | 30                     | 20                    |\n| other soft blocks                       | 50                     | 40                    |\n| hard blocks (obsidian, netherite, etc.) | 5                      | 5                     |\n| wool                                    | 50                     | 40                    |\n| snow                                    | 55                     | 55                    |\n| moss                                    | 60                     | 60                    |\n| dirt, clay                              | 45                     | 45                    |\n| ore blocks                              | 15                     | 10                    |\n| melon, pumpkin                          | 35                     | 25                    |\n| quartz                                  | 25                     | 25                    |\n| basalt                                  | 15                     | 15                    |\n| tuff, calcite, netherrack               | 25                     | 20                    |\n| deepslate (including bricks)            | 10                     | 10                    |\n| unoxidized copper                       | 10                     | 10                    |\n| exposed copper                          | 40                     | 40                    |\n| weathered copper                        | 70                     | 70                    |\n| oxidized copper                         | 100                    | 100                   |\n| glowstone                               | 30                     | 30                    |\n| nether wart, warped wart                | 45                     | 45                    |\n| amethyst                                | 35                     | 25                    |\n\nThis mod also adds \"double smooth stone slab\" and \"petrified oak planks\" blocks, respectively crafted from smooth stone slabs and petrified oak slabs. Vanilla smooth stone blocks can still be crafted into smooth stone slabs.\n\nBlocks added by this mod inherit most features of their base blocks:\n\n- **Wool and planks** blocks (which means blocks in based on wool or planks different shapes) are flammable (burning time and spreading speed equal vanilla full blocks).\n- **Wool, planks, wood and log** blocks can be used as fuel. Slabs and vertical slabs, when used as fuel, can consume half the time of their base blocks. Buttons used as fuels smelt about 1/3 the time of their base blocks. Quarter pieces and vertical quarter pieces, when used as fuel, smelt 1/4 the time of the base blocks.\n- **Wool** blocks, no matter whether they occupy the space of a whole block, can block sculk sensors.\n    - Note that in vanilla, wool carpets dampen vibrations but cannot occlude signals. However, all woolen blocks in this mod occlude all vibration signals.\n- **Netherrack** blocks are infiniburn.\n- **Bedrock** blocks are infiniburn in the end. They are not harvestable in Survival Mode. However, bedrock buttons and pressure plates may drop when they lose the blocks they relie on.\n- **Endstone, obsidian and crying obsidian** blocks are immune to ender dragons.\n- **Netherite** blocks and **ancient debris** blocks, when dropped as items, resist fire and lava.\n- **Gold and raw gold** blocks can be admired by piglins.\n- Breaking **gold blocks, raw gold blocks and gilded blackstone** blocks irritates piglins.\n- A **snow** stairs or snow slab, when placed on a grass block, if it just covers the whole top of the grass block, makes it snowy, just like covered by a snow block or snow.\n- Small dripleaves and large dripleaves can be placed on blocks base on **moss blocks and clay** (only building blocks).\n- Blocks base on **pumpkin, melon, moss block, shroomlight, nether wart block and warped wart block** can be composted.\n- Blocks based on **packed ice and sculk block** drop only mined with items with Silk Touch enchantment.\n- Blocks based on **clay block, snow block, melon block**, etc., drop their corresponding items when mined, such as clay ball, snow ball (only when shoveled) and melon slice. Number of items dropped by slabs, quarter pieces, vertical slabs, vertical slabs are based on that of base blocks divided by 2 or 4, and double slabs drop the double. Some items dropped may be affected by Fortune enchantment, and blocks themselves are dropped when mined with tools with Silk Touch.\n- About the interaction between blocks and pistons: for blocks that cannot be pushed by piston, such as obsidian, bedrock, the buttons and pressure plates can also not be pushed by piston, while buttons and pressure plates for other blocks will be directly destroyed.\n- About note block: To be consistent with vanilla, the note block instrument of button blocks are always harp, while others are same as their base blocks.\n- Buttons will not be displayed as colors in maps.\n- **Copper** blocks, like vanilla copper blocks, can be oxidized, and be de-oxidized by using axes or being hit by lighting bolt. They can also be waxed and de-waxed. Oxidation of waxed copper does not change.\n\n### Crafting and smelting\n\nThe crafting recipes for all blocks in this mod are similar to those in vanilla. Stone and metal blocks can also be made with a stonecutter. Stairs can be crafted 3:2 in a crafting table (ingredient:result) and 1:1 in the stone cutter. Slabs and vertical slabs are craftable 1:2 in either crafting table or stone cutter.\n\nSlabs, stairs and quarter pieces can be rotated in crafting recipes to be corresponding vertical blocks; you can also \"rotate them back\". For instance, one slab can be crafted into one corresponding vertical slab, and one vertical slab can also be crafted into a corresponding slab directly.\n\nCrafting recipes of blocks in different shapes are as follows:\n\n- 6×base blocks → 4×stairs\n- 3×base blocks → 6×slabs\n- 3×slabs → 6×quarter pieces (slabs arranged horizontally)\n- 1×slab ↔ 1×vertical slab\n- 1×stairs ↔ 1×vertical stairs\n- 1×quarter piece ↔ 1×vertical quarter piece\n- 3×vertical slabs → 6×vertical quarter pieces (vertical slabs arranged vertically)\n\nStone-cutting recipe of some blocks are as follows:\n\n- 1×base block → 1×stairs / 1×vertical stairs / 2×slabs / 2×vertical slabs / 4×quarter pieces / 4×vertical quarter pieces\n- 1×stairs → 3×quarter pieces\n- 1×slab → 2×quarter pieces\n- 1×vertical stairs → 3×vertical quarter pieces\n- 1×vertical slab → 2×quarter pieces / 2×vertical quarter pieces\n\nIn stonecutters, one base blocks can be cut into various shapes for cut base blocks. For instance, a stone can be cut into stone bricks, and stone bricks can be cut into 2 vertical stone brick slabs, while one stone can also be cut directly into 2 vertical stone brick slabs. However, blocks of various shapes cannot be cut into their corresponding shapes of cut base blocks.\n\nThe second crafting ingredient for crafting fences and fences (apart from base blocks_ is dependent to its base block. See details in block list.\n\nTo avoid recipe conflicts, some blocks are not craftable. For example, iron blocks can be crafted to iron ingots only, instead of iron buttons; pumpkins can be crafted to pumpkin seeds only, instead of pumpkin buttons. Besides, wool pressure plates and moss pressure plates are not craftable, but can be crafted one from three wool carpets or moss carpets. Snow slabs can not be crafted directly from snow, either; instead, craft a snow (layer) with three snow blocks, and then craft the slab with the snow. You can test potential recipe conflicts via `/extshape:check-conflict` command.\n\nAll recipes can be unlocked when obtaining any of the base block. To put explicitly, each recipe has a corresponding advancement, and as soon as the player obtains the base block or unlocks the recipe, the advancement is triggered and relative recipe is unlocked.\n\nYou can configure to cancel avoiding recipes that conflict. For instance, if you disable \"prevent wooden wall recipes\", wooden walls can be crafted like other wall blocks, which conflict with the recipe of wooden trapdoors. It's advised to modify these settings on condition that you have installed mods that can solve recipe conflict. You can access the mod configuration screen via Mod Menu (of Fabric) or Forge, or typing command `/extshape:config` in game.\n\nAll unwaxed copper blocks can be crafted with honeycomb into corresponding waxed blocks.\n\n### Creative Inventory\n\nIn versions above 1.19.3, items in these mod will by default be added to vanilla item groups. If you do not want to add items into vanilla item groups, instead add four specific groups to place blocks in various shapes in the order of their base blocks, you may go to the config screen of the mod (which can be accessed through the mod menu of Mod Menu mod), and disable \"Add to vanilla groups\" and enable \"Show specific groups\".\n\nIn versions 1.19.2 and before, if you enabled \"Add to vanilla groups\", mods will be directly appended after all existing blocks, which may make item groups appear messy. You may install Reasonable Sorting mod to sort the content. (Reasonable Sorting mod does not support versions above 1.19.3, and it is also not needed.)\n\nYou may also configure the shapes to be added into groups. For example, if you enable \"add to vanilla groups\", and set \"shapes added to vanilla groups\" to `stairs slab`, then only stairs and slabs in this mod are added into vanilla groups (not affecting vanilla existing items). For 1.19.3, the shapes are added in order (but cannot be duplicate). For example, if you write `slab stairs`, stairs will be added after the slabs (vanilla stairs and slabs will not be affected).\n\n## Inter-mod support\n\nThe mod can currently add utilities with Blockus mod.\n\n### Blockus\n\nIf you have installed Extended Block Shapes and Blockus mod, you may optionally install \"Extended Block Shapes - Blockus\" mod based on that two mods, so that extended shapes for Blockus blocks will also be added.\n\nNote: There are no specific groups for these blocks. Therefore, to find these blocks in creative inventory, you need to enable \"Add to vanilla groups\" in the mod options of \"Extended Block Shapes\", and find these blocks in Blockus item groups.\n","published":"2021-09-02T06:10:43.921627Z","updated":"2024-06-16T07:57:30.561374Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":20965,"followers":102,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","21w39a","21w40a","21w43a","21w44a","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre4","1.18-rc1","1.18-rc2","1.18-rc3","1.18-rc4","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","22w45a","22w46a","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3-pre3","1.19.3-rc3","1.19.3","23w07a","1.19.4-rc3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre4","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w10a","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["EpuERo2m","sE30Gn3G","D94TbM9L","WofUbDIc","16p5qoji","qE392bCY","Fc6ailyx","7Q6W0SiI","32TwR43q","AlquYb53","aTOvEbmJ","3pI5kHid","Cm6WTbUN","roC64Mqr","4u5Xugs7","FfH3qeL9","xpBTjbno","4LjBSUU8","rQHr8LyP","31kipbRd","mq8wYqMw","zNOPRpbj","DRThYbm7","f6ljCwx3","1UpmbFT3","yYhJb3xW","tkhIFwh7","3AAdO7I7","LZUn5bmP","SPR3xqwO","fV2p32MH","JDpe8BUz","umqL4CYF","lak9RZqc","YoiB4xui","hNa4eDDO","rLMWY3GT","65OX8Llf","GBiMOL1g","FUL1dFhO","4u8w4GmZ","lUjUEx6q","YgJ2fwuM","7SsxnRCb","Y0P99wX3","pyEaI33U","tdgTgR2f","LX5AxHFd","IGJCPnK3","u5z8eMR1","Iwn0pC5V","GOJfq0Wg","HJcHOlhv","GVqRHGNd","ACgcWu80","q1wx0qoE","j9nkjfjm","P3Z9KA1F","9z8n93vL","2uvSQYAc","w963hnRm","6AFAMGRb","3EqgkDDr","zuVIRVAg","qHarRyUx","capMSWkY","bKlVtoUa","SQwh1f8Y","DhXeCjlg","rsbIQ5s9","nLuFmPkW","mcZD6Kjh","Qc5AnjkA","z6vmj0u0","7X3yl6Id","fPrsnvYK","hpyCSrwd","tQapphHA","cOuOnKVY","CJZzuZ39","C0vdq2a1","YozJ6bCx","Gukos7r5","9yiO4VkV","hpkegzIE","bNr1Khp3","Fy4OB9gO","QUyyCEud","rPjbQwG3","kC0XgZ32","cfdFa2vV","sFqYijgW","qYaHfkOQ","wo5AJrSO","Il7XutuH","J5wlVzY5","s699n8Jo","InVbAgSi","bsVBhLsR","mJ8EOtQk","aO5wAYxW","NeQ5NPs8","JCKYacSK","bvvTOUYo","inClrSnK","gRl5ZSo1","HfEWkv8q","NXbKR0hn","Xg2KVU8J","BKKNnM8u","ZyHNo3tq","rVu50eTh","lhOjVgQz","oFpQTRI3","PFrQRjfU","iB4XUaHS","CU1qE7vB","GFPMmAWs","KHAJ102z","sfO4QO8E","BFfgfMnI","M59wP5mi","mjUteqDc","Y0LXqj1u","nX0yXhoe","Uk8K8O01","YuoufTIc","3N2kwRV6","XkQ1EQr8","9WMC7yFF","cPofw3bQ","q1gWsttN","hb7LVyKf","ABBGoxj3","pKlS3DgB","VykQ5sth","j2RYbFjx","RhPRPmi3","8LTKsZCq","zMKYasGJ","7olDB2JS","amFwS7eS","rbyvQmGZ","9V3GLPuQ","RukR9g2r","uUwUrHwn"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tb7kCxSW/83a11835eedff22fefcbec9db79bf532a0b9f05d.png"},"version":{"id":"amFwS7eS","project_id":"tb7kCxSW","author_id":"xAJ2OzsA","featured":false,"name":"2.1.4-fabric-1.21","version_number":"2.1.4-fabric-1.21","changelog":"- Updated to 1.21.\n- Added sounds added by this mod into the registry.\n- Added colored blocks to corresponding tags in Fabric Conventional Tags in Fabric API.\n- Since 1.21, removed tuff stairs, tuff slab and tuff wall, as those blocks are formally added in Minecraft.

To create your own, simply replace `modmenu` at the end (***NOT*** the one in the beginning) of the translation key with your own mod ID, for example `modmenu.descriptionTranslation.traverse`.\n\n`en_pt.json`\n```json\n\"modmenu.nameTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods!\",\n\"modmenu.descriptionTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\",\n\"modmenu.summaryTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\"\n```\n\n> The summary translation is redundant here and does not need to be included because it's the same as the description, but it was included to show that you may translate the summary (a short, one-sentence description of the mod) separately from the description, even in English!\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Fabric Metadata API\nThere's a number of things you can add just with metadata in your `fabric.mod.json`.\n\nAll of these are added to a custom block in your `fabric.mod.json` for Mod Menu's metadata. Here's an example usage of many of the features this API provides:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n      },\n      \"badges\": [ \"library\", \"deprecated\" ],\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"id\": \"example-api\",\n        \"name\": \"Example API\",\n        \"description\": \"Modular example library\",\n        \"icon\": \"assets/example-api-module-v1/parent_icon.png\",\n        \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n      },\n      \"update_checker\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fabric Metadata API Documentation</summary>\n\n#### Badges (`\"badges\": [ ]`)\nWhile the `Client` badge is added automatically to mods set as client-side only (set `\"environment\": \"client\"` in `fabric.mod.json` to do this.), other badges such as the `Library` and `Deprecated` badges require definition here.\n\nSupported values:\n- `library` - should be assigned to mods that are purely dependencies for other mods that should not be shown to the user by default unless they toggle them on.\n- `deprecated` - should be assigned to mods that exist purely for legacy reasons, such as an old API module or such.\n\nAny others will be ignored, and Mod Menu does not support adding your own badges. You may open an issue [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/issues) if you have a compelling use case for a new badge.\n\n#### Links (`\"links\": { }`)\nThe `links` object allows mod authors to add custom hyperlinks to the end of their description. If you specify a `sources` contact in the official `fabric.mod.json` metadata, it will also be included in the links section.\n\nAny key in the `links` object will be included in the links section, with the key being used as a translation key. For example, this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nwill show as a link with the text \"Discord\", since \"Discord\" is the English translation of \"modmenu.discord\" provided by Mod Menu.\n\nMod Menu provides several default translations that can be used for links. A full list can be seen in Mod Menu's language file [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/blob/-/src/main/resources/assets/modmenu/lang/en_us.json). All default link translation keys take the form `modmenu.<type>`.\n\nYou can also provide your own translations if you would like to add custom links. Make sure to use ***your own namespace*** (as opposed to `modmenu`) for any custom keys.\n\n#### Parents (`\"parent\": \"mod_id\" or { }`)\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZutCprf.png\">\n\nParents are used to display a mod as a child of another one. This is meant to be used for mods divided into different modules. The following element in a `fabric.mod.json` will define the mod as a child of the mod 'flamingo': \n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": \"flamingo\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to group mods under a parent, but the parent isn't an actual mod, you can do that too. In the example below, a mod is defining metadata for a parent. Make sure that this metadata is included in all of the children that use the fake/dummy parent. This can also be used as a fallback for an optional parent, it will be replace by the mod's real metadata if present.\n\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": {\n            \"id\": \"this-mod-isnt-real\",\n            \"name\": \"Fake Mod\",\n            \"description\": \"Do cool stuff with this fake mod\",\n            \"icon\": \"assets/real-mod/fake-mod-icon.png\",\n            \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDummy parent mods only support the following metadata:\n- `id` (String)\n- `name` (String)\n- `description` (String)\n- `icon` (String)\n- `badges` (Array of Strings)\n\n\n#### Disable update checker (`\"update_checker\": false`)\nBy default, Mod Menu's update checker will use the hash of your mod's jar to lookup the latest version on Modrinth. If it finds a matching project, it will check for the latest version that supports your mod loader and Minecraft version, and if it has a different hash from your existing file, it will prompt the user that there is an update available.\n\nYou can disable the update checker by setting `update_checker` to false in your Mod Menu metadata like so:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"update_checker\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Quilt Metadata API\nSince Mod Menu supports Quilt as well, the same APIs in the Fabric Metadata API section are also available for Quilt mods, but the format for custom metadata is slightly different. \n\nInstead of a `\"modmenu\"` block inside of a `\"custom\"` block, you put the `\"modmenu\"` block as an element in the root object. So it should look like:\n\n`quilt.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"modmenu\": {\n    // Here's where your links, badges, etc. stuff goes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Java API\nTo use the Java API, you'll need to add Mod Menu as a compile-time dependency in your gradle project. This won't make your mod require Mod Menu, but it'll be present in your environment for you to test with.\n\n`build.gradle`\n```gradle\n// Add the Terraformers maven repo to your repositories block\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    name = \"Terraformers\"\n    url = \"https://maven.terraformersmc.com/\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Mod Menu as a dependency in your environment\ndependencies {\n  modImplementation(\"com.terraformersmc:modmenu:${project.modmenu_version}\")\n}\n```\nThen, define the version of Mod Menu you're using in your `gradle.properties`. You can get the latest version number [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/latest), but you may need a different version if you're not using the latest Minecraft version. See the [versions page](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions) for a full list of versions.\n\n`gradle.properties`\n```properties\nmodmenu_version=VERSION_NUMBER_HERE\n```\n> If you don't want it in your environment for testing but still want to compile against Mod Menu for using the Java API, you can use `modCompileOnly` instead of `modImplementation` (this will work even if Mod Menu is not updated to the version of Minecraft you're running).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Java API Documentation</summary>\n\n### Getting Started\nTo use the API, implement the ModMenuApi interface on a class and add that as an entry point of type \"modmenu\" in your `fabric.mod.json` like this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"modmenu\": [ \"com.example.mod.ExampleModMenuApiImpl\" ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mod Config Screens\nMods can provide a Screen factory to provide a custom config screen to open with the config button. Implement the `getModConfigScreenFactory` method in your API implementation to do this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for mods to provide their own config screens. The mod id of the config screen is automagically determined by the source mod container that the entrypoint originated from.\n\n### Provided Config Screens\nMods can provide Screen factories to provide a custom config screens to open with the config buttons for other mods as well. Implement the `getProvidedConfigScreenFactories` method in your API implementation for this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for a mod like Cloth Config to provide config screens for mods that use its API.\n\n### Modpack Badges\nMods can give other mods the `Modpack` badge by implementing the `attachModpackBadges` method, such as through the following:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void attachModpackBadges(Consumer<String> consumer) {\n\tconsumer.accept(\"modmenu\"); // Indicates that 'modmenu' is part of the modpack\n}\n```\n\nNote that 'internal' mods such as Minecraft itself and the mod loader cannot be given the modpack badge, as they are not distributed within a typical modpack.\n\n### Static Helper Methods\n`ModMenuApi` also offers a few helper methods for mods that want to work with Mod Menu better, like making their own Mods buttons.\n\n#### Creating a Mods screen instance\nYou can call this method to get an instance of the Mods screen:\n```java\nScreen createModsScreen(Screen previous)\n```\n\n#### Creating a Mods button `Text`\nYou can call this method to get the Text that would be displayed on a Mod Menu Mods button:\n```java\nText createModsButtonText()\n```\n\n</details>","published":"2020-11-06T05:11:04.725058Z","updated":"2024-06-21T14:44:42.928177Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":7838519,"followers":9914,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.4","1.16.5","21w06a","21w14a","1.17-pre1","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","22w15a","22w16b","22w17a","22w18a","22w19a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","1.19.3","23w03a","23w05a","23w07a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4-pre2","1.19.4-pre3","1.19.4-pre4","1.19.4-rc1","1.19.4-rc2","1.19.4-rc3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","23w18a","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","23w40a","23w42a","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","24w03a","24w03b","24w04a","24w05a","24w05b","24w06a","24w07a","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M3KFXLhq","DgzrfgAZ","O90fUm3q","zC13OZD9","7QWIhei3","79rtoAM6","kBofQyu4","TleLdS1A","PqgXyy3N","Mnl0OeFI","pxj9L3Vy","6YvLIUDN","wb5nbuL5","bPE0GIoY","pqlMITZQ","RIf7gcLA","Gz5wa6j2","EDbIonje","wRE7Emzz","mzVbb1XI","bHODZExo","a8bewBQT","NyFB1gry","oQr5VO7q","u955lyFM","E4QBMVtO","c6uDXZX8","bojzkt4w","4Ar2wg0k","G8sCBZ1X","JyL5b75a","GOPQZTVp","Wr4GfZdy","tlM0eBmY","DOitjZ89","XtL1i60M","VaZTuVan","FMqdptUn","aH8qgnVM","9xECQHnM","LVxVja5i","JOqf8AZn","WKj0jgYj","jZQ0G78K","PN4NcBa1","WkUCkcQA","3CD6YUw1","JPP6w2U1","eueI9czw","4JrWqhWw","Ui2loaCY","fw5MM4c4","6f25OJ7w","E4VKK6kQ","y8cYdaYa","GYRoFp1I","Tk7mCRX1","aShj7736","dP3zrFbp","cx9D94fU","pnFEFiHq","ybXxCvz4","NsD1IoUs","oU5qfeR6","2Ys0a7JE","8TOgNwQL","kQDE01D3","3umfHb6R","Gbkn1raO","d86kV6wd","NAs8eiQa","RxrqnH1z","GI1HTA1O","sI3kiPZE","4dReZoTJ","7mdkE3Od","qDXCbEz4","IPLgxPn7","V4hnfgRO","nVxObSbX","7kh2ofyR","eIrlBn1Z","yA8g3pEj","oqeCO757","4LXaG2xg","5qqTBb38","7E8dbVv0","5aw4r6fS","pyDmgV07","jRqFAHRH","4EOA40rU","gSoPJyVn","RtaGQNyd","sXVmzBDB","U31K6311","JYTmttex","pged5sGx","5e62j63G","nM5QaZNo","aMxXwo9x","3gwnUSKz","yjjsLqbS","RdCGzY7B","EuNUYds8","iZRiOnnj","M7LIgtWJ","RTFDnTKf","CtMNOUcV","zv46i3PW","VHzvWfY2","sLzitH81","id0aLmxO","eTCL1uh8","lMqXEzUw","jbNN4rAs","lEkperf6","sMAXpy0X","TwfjidT5","qpKaDJtd","Edgke5GX","tXEHCONL","4EYB2Bxx","fCQyI9Zj","sjtVVlsA","ua8KrvY4","mtTzRMV2","w3icASIi","VOHp29AO","ybV7vGT5","NgnZx44E","9FL4cmP7","KXx8jdVE","YLesFuAc","I7OSH8Gw","jnj30PDT","HLa8flfl","FawTQg29","lJ1xXMce","xhN1IvHi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/1b6bcdef5a3d92572f517122650716be7ec6458b.webp"},"version":{"id":"lJ1xXMce","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","author_id":"uF4fzWRt","featured":false,"name":"v11.0.0

Free Levels","description":"Flattens the ever-increasing anvil and enchantment costs and makes renaming items always cost 1 level","body":"Reaching high levels in Minecraft is hard, because each level requires more XP than the last.  \n<br>\nSince Anvils and Enchantment Tables work off of levels, not off of collected XP, that means the higher your level, the higher the actual cost in terms of XP.  \n<br>\nTax Free Levels flattens the curve of the ever-increasing anvil and enchantment costs above level 30, meaning you'll always pay the same amount of XP, regardless of how high your level is.   \nIt also makes it so that renaming an item always only costs 1 level.  \n<br>\nMore precisely:  \nIf you are above level 30, instead of e.g. paying 3 levels, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from level 27 to 30.  \nIf the level cost is above 30, you pay the amount of XP needed to get from 0 to that level.\n\n* for Fabric Minecraft 1.16-1.20\n* required on the server and client\n* (it *does* work server-only, but the level cost won't show up correctly when renaming items)\n* compatible with Draylar1's [Reroll](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reroll)\n* compatible with [Enchanting Overhauled](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchanting-overhauled)\n* compatible with [Enchanting Infuser](https://modrinth.com/mod/enchanting-infuser)\n* compatible with

[Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/waystones) (older (Neo)Forge versions, newer ones use an XP cost by default. Fabric tip: [Wraith Waystones]([https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones)) can set fixed XP cost)\n* compatible with [Apotheosis](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis) / [Zenith]([https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/zenith](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/zenith)) (7.2.0+ / 1.0.0+ cost calculation will be replaced, note that the shown XP cost isn't always accurate)\n* **incompatible** with [Balanced Enchanting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/balanced-enchanting) (the mod does effectively the same thing as this mod, minus all the compatibility stuff, choose one or the other)\n\n### Comparison\n\nSay you've just slain the Ender Dragon for the first time and reached level 68.  \nIn Vanilla, you can level 3 enchant a total of 13 items.  \nWith Tax Free Levels, this changes to 35 items, your Ender Dragon kill actually counts for something!  \n<br>\nSay again, you reached level 68 and want to apply another enchantment on your pick which has a very high repair cost and it'd cost 35 levels.  \nIn Vanilla, you pay 10220 XP (the XP needed to get from level 33 to 68).  \nWith Tax Free Levels, you pay 2045 XP (the XP needed to get from level 0 to 35).  \n\nYou'd normally lose 8000 of your 12000 XP dragon reward here and there!\n\n### No Small Tax\n\nOne small tidbit about vanilla Minecraft is that paying levels doesn't actually touch the percental experience progress.  \nSince higher levels are worth more XP, this means you actually not only pay levels but also a small amount of XP.  \nTax Free Levels gets rid of this tax as well, even at lower player levels.\n\n### Attribution\nThis is meant as a partial replacement for user11681's limitless, specifically the \"level normalization\". No code was taken, only the idea.","published":"2021-04-11T09:38:08.008060Z","updated":"2024-05-23T12:43:09.660636Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":169025,"followers":400,"categories":["game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["kyjJQ6is","NQmkmN36","2maMKx5T","6jbcl9c6","EGIMsnwc","fjgH8VUW","TuxALvSu","HnEdtPAA","OuxiHpnF","BPNCpouX","d4aBYiqJ","MZ3KFvJD","xRFlf1Co","Yzz234vY","KIjmjizn","LjDUjZCq","yEyvB3UM","6RvulguJ","wQCx7LxJ","bMwjs3jk","Snmnhtv7","O5rb19U4","HVJFHnm0","hTA88KZf","k7fgGv6V","UdBtR2xM","I0zqOeJG","gZ1xkqNs","AlYgBMY1","FIBdjomr","B0IoQ4DN","hpR2Y8l4","gaDYXPBy","tkf6AdLD"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jCBrrLTs/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"B0IoQ4DN","project_id":"jCBrrLTs","author_id":"INxNlPeV","featured":false,"name":"1.3.12-fabric","version_number":"1.3.12","changelog":"-

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

In 1.17, the Spyglass item was added to Minecraft. If you're like me, you've probably never found a use for it. It's a hassle to bring with you in the hotbar, and selecting it even more so. The zoom function is incredibly useful though. And with this mod, you'll be able to use it anywhere. Think of it as spawning with a spyglass, in any world.<br><br>By default the hotkey used to zoom in is Left Alt, but this can be set in the Keybind menu. While pressing this, a spyglass item is temporarily added to the offhand. The spyglass is automatically used, until the hotkey is let go. This will also make the spyglass item disappear again. Any held item in the offhand will return as soon as the hotkey is unpressed.<br></span><strong><br></strong><strong><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The effect in action:</span><br></strong></p>\r\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\r\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/vanilla-zoom/b.gif\"></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\">The Hotkey:</span><br><img src=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/vanilla-zoom/a.jpg\"><br></strong><strong><br></strong><br>------------------<br><br><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>You may freely use this mod in any modpack, as long as the download remains hosted within the Modrinth ecosystem.</strong></span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:18px\"><a style=\"font-size:18px;color:#008000\" href=\"https://serilum.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serilum.com</a> contains an overview and more information on all mods available.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Comments are disabled as I'm unable to keep track of all the separate pages on each mod.</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><br>For issues, ideas, suggestions or anything else there is the&nbsp;<a style=\"font-size:14px;color:#008000\" href=\"https://github.com/Serilum/.issue-tracker\" rel=\"nofollow\">Github repo</a>.

(but not really)™ for Blay's multiplatform mods. This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

blazingly fast development times\n\n - [owo-config](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/config/), a built-in, customizable configuration system built on top of owo-ui. It provides many of the same features as [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) while many new conveniences, like server-client config synchronization, added on top\n\n - A fully automatic [registration system](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/registration/) that is designed to be as generic as possible. It is simple and non-verbose to use for basic registries, yet the underlying API tree is flexible and can also be used for many custom registration solutions\n\n - [Item Group extensions](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/item-groups/) which allow for sub-tabs inside your mod's group as well as a host of other features like custom buttons, textures and item variant handling\n\n - A fully-featured [networking layer](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/networking/) with fully automatic serialization, handshaking to ensure client compatibility and a built-in solution for triggering parametrized particle events in a side-agnostic manner\n\n - Client-sided particle helpers that allow for easily composing multi-particle effects\n\n - Rich text translations, allowing you to use Minecraft's text component format in your language files to provide styled text without any code\n\n***\n\nowo is documented in two main ways:\n\n - There is rich, detailed JavaDoc throughout the entire codebase\n - There is a wiki with in-depth explanations and tutorials for most of owo's features over at https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/features/","published":"2021-09-30T20:46:31.667429Z","updated":"2024-06-15T21:22:13.415089Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1739167,"followers":689,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","21w43a","1.18-pre8","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["HyvkCi1L","4NeTD3y0","ERFRuuW5","IPVeGmcd","LmWOyXVW","flVS3RS0","PptbPV7y","1WqSpJvo","F6DR79FV","1E69wiMJ","eAlYR8cf","Jfd8qbEF","3Qzf5TkU","lT5Mm5fS","6LkUrYRt","vnSwwEYV","2QnmkZKc","q3Sxg4SA","i8cpzMnQ","GqwSx15g","aWqxWaL7","zVhs4uLj","WJsP5KWE","F4LqV8lu","aXMVV7gj","uAXx21D1","C46ht027","HqAtE0un","NzQ8iAeC","RV8F1iab","Dmqb8GqA","bJtMgK25","lEVNuJ3B","fr6mJFIx","JX2OM2ED","2yMO9WGE","yGLYmVnT","gsbvHClE","LI7k719Y","KMwbSA7v","gmwB5dLB","ORA8RfoA","T8DsELMD","5QgPEzLH","beTZr7PG","DgIYuFEF","m23n3uIM","zyOBB7J4","oLoJCrky","DYgDdRtg","rGwQL6vN","9NFjhCIH","LWhxwhvI","HYGIKGSR","HEZ55HbJ","CJ29u2GJ","Her7Z3CG","ueejHgQH","cFeG2MJS","5qH0boef","gizS7nlP","1fKeD2p9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ccKDOlHs/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"1fKeD2p9","project_id":"ccKDOlHs","author_id":"qGOpk8Hs","featured":false,"name":"[1.21] oωo - 0.12.10","version_number":"0.12.10+1.21","changelog":"This build is primarily a port of [0.12.9](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib/version/0.12.9+1.20.5) to 1.21.

Instead, owo now uses and ships the standalone [endec](https://github.com/wisp-forest/endec) library. This entails four major changes:\n- Endecs for Minecraft's types are no longer found on `BuiltInEndecs` but instead on `MinecraftEndecs`\n- DFU interop (namely, converting between codecs and endecs) is now handled through `CodecUtils.toCodec/toEndec` and related functions\n- A number of package changes, primarily `io.wispforest.owo.serialization` -> `io.wispforest.endec`\n- All JSON-related implementations are now named after the JSON library they use. In consequence, the previous `JsonSerializer` is now `GsonSerializer` and so on\n\n### Further Fixes\n- `EdmOps` no longer uses `null` as its empty value, fixing a number of edge cases with particular types of DFU codecs when doing interop\n- owo's `ScreenHandler` extensions don't require a `HandledScreen` anymore and now also support other screens which implement `ScreenHandlerProvider","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-15T21:22:14.416329Z","downloads":4915,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b2922b4a85e87a2c6cd2fc9f4b0e6a6ea802bcf517217a050e65b274093a4a54cc4893a2f35e70c18c3db4181f928e3f780049c89ca422e888d1379ab14ba9b2","sha1":"858bad410c22e96a863e6f76d8a14966bf53fc9c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ccKDOlHs/versions/1fKeD2p9/owo-lib-0.12.10%2B1.21.jar","filename":"owo-lib-0.12.10+1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":1130416,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"1c274c7aaf6dbc6fefb481564ad50b1e84023fcb","sha512":"4afca634ed36ea57a176a8308084a312a8a89d60dc6eb63cf5b43c9a7341fa10e631031db9471d2a3bde707ff69f1d1e586311d84c6d64d4cbaeb1749557c783"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ccKDOlHs/versions/1fKeD2p9/owo-lib-0.12.10%2B1.21-sources.jar","filename":"owo-lib-0.12.10+1.21-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":418726,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"SH3qQlP1","user":{"id":"oUr8bDkh","username":"BasiqueEvangelist","name":"Basique Evangelist","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72868417?v=4","bio":"Owl in the snow","created":"2021-02-11T15:51:47.003437Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"SH3qQlP1","user":{"id":"qGOpk8Hs","username":"glisco","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15788224?v=4","bio":"she/her | creative director & tech lead\n@ Wisp Forest (https://github.com/wisp-forest)\n\n","created":"2021-03-13T09:39:29.068275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"SH3qQlP1","user":{"id":"7DNYExCh","username":"Blodhgarm","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50533513?v=4","bio":"Fabric/Multiloader Mod Developer at heart with an affinity for developing mods with interesting challenges.","created":"2021-08-22T01:18:14.993460Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"owo-lib-0.12.10+1.21.jar"},"mods\\IronDoorKey-FABRIC-1.21-1.1.jar":{"sha512":"9096fa4196ea19af538680bed6694a4ec042082bcf73c3708838fb520ee11a492c44b2cf05abe687ab4419cae85e8d2462a10142e85e0c93444aa8df07e48934","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"W2nExUfn","slug":"iron-door-key","project_type":"mod","team":"7tpsfXZm","title":"Iron Door Key","description":"Adds iron door key to open iron doors and trapdoors","body":"## About\n\n#### Iron Door Key adds as its name suggests iron door key.

Based on and made enhancements on ARRP mod.","body":"\nBRRP (Better Runtime Resource Pack), is a library mod used for generate resources at runtime, which is a branch of [ARRP](https://github.com/Devan-Kerman/ARRP) (Advanced Runtime Resource Pack) mod.\n\nWelcome to join Tencent QQ group **587928350** or KOOK (KaiHeiLa) channel invitation code **KlFS0n** to experience the latest update of this mod.\n\nNotice: Since version 1.0.0, the ID of the mod was changed from `better_runtime_resource_pack` to `brrp_v1`, and modified the code without compatibility for older versions, but can co-exist with older versions. Unless needed, please do not used old version.\n\n## What is a runtime resource pack?\n\nRuntime resource pack (RRP) refers to asset and data files generated when Minecraft is running, in avoidance of some repetitive works. For mods with masses of similar blocks and items, runtime resource pack helps to significantly reduce the size of mod file.\n\nFor instance, the loot table of most blocks can be described as \"drop the block itself\". Some blocks drop only when with Silk Touch. For slab blocks, when double slab block is broken, two blocks are dropped instead of one. In loot tables, each block requires a loot table JSON file; creating them is quite time-consuming. Moreover, almost each block requires a \"block states\", block model and item model (block models may be more than one). If loot tables and recipes (if it exists) are counted, each block requires at least 5 JSONs to achieve full features. In contrast, runtime resource packs make them generated inside the game instance, instead of stored in the mod JAR file.\n\nRuntime resource packs have no difference than regular resource packs with regard to features. Normal resource packs (including the mod's builtin resource and manually-installed resource-packs or data-packs) can override contents of runtime resource packs, or have relations to runtime resource packs. A typical example is, block models are defined in runtime resource packs, and their texture files are stored in mod files as usual (as it's not appropriate to generate texture files in runtime).\n\nCompared to traditional resource packs, runtime resource packs reduce I/Os, but adds the process of object serialization, which is a drawback of runtime resource pack. When resource packs are generated, objects are converted to byte forms (usually JSON). This process is called *serialization*. When game instance reads these resource packs, these byte-form contents are analysed to generate objects in game. This process is called *deserialization*. In traditional resource packs, all resources are serialized, and the game instance needs only to deserialize them when loading resources. However, runtime resource packs require the process of both serialization and deserialization.\n\nTo summarize again the process traditional resource packs and runtime resource packs are read in game:\n\n- *Traditional* File → (read as) byte form → (deserialized as) in-game objects\n- *Runtime* Code → ARRP objects → (serialized as) byte form → (deserialized as) in-game objects\n\nIt's been in my plan to make it possible to directly use objects generated in game in future versions, without the process of deserialization and serialization. This is already possible in theory, but to be in the form of resource pack and allow overriding by traditional resource packs and data packs, some further research is required.\n\n## About this mod\n\nThis mod (BRRP) is a branch of ARRP. Since 1.0.0, this mod has become independent of ARRP, no longer provides features of ARRP, but can co-exist with ARRP mod.\n\nThis mod is open-source and published under the MPLv2 license.\n\n\n**More details are available on GitHub.**","published":"2022-04-26T06:55:40.394973Z","updated":"2024-06-16T07:44:45.676905Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":63099,"followers":82,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","22w45a","22w46a","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3-pre3","1.19.3-rc3","1.19.3","23w07a","1.19.4-rc3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre4","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w10a","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["HYlvQhzw","cuU3SFjF","KCV7X1vA","SQlIosLZ","iVYYDiDZ","Dzz9FkAu","vA88X7uE","6tkZrNyx","umDYhsTx","3SpJslgg","tKxhUOtK","LzrO6rfT","pNNEJG3T","8QFXxELM","DedV30iU","VG4xwtdh","AF6L2T9H","N6E2M0pN","lmTI25r3","rzwV0WaH","n43G4GAi","UVJ1YNgd","5OSPFKXi","WkAOFyuR","kfaauP2d","4AJPHzZ7","XOO2UMGh","OY90k7jS","8IRT7zqv","cnJlnvDM","ZDZb13d1","3yqP8XMN","K2eXuNao","qRR8fZSX","J3pxXfQy","Vmsff6NQ","p6QKMT7o","FRV0SICP","52yXRQFx","Q47tuVnD","91zA44qZ","xshj03Ox","EYIYJj5P","edVfb0c7","wjxyCpKl","e6QsgJuz","rOqmFbfW","jKMRc4Pu","YWCjwlvX","zYhI4Jkd","zrFdVWki","cAzJcAJx","S8eRLHUF","ducNBGEq","AZQn5xSm","qBQF16iX","JkMpHEfB","OxSO6D78","7QA1rCRf","IYDgJuEe","wF8rfN5J","Rv7tkZGi","sdfdVcMa","LRcCSiCC","vLbAIDLx","IJqCOM84","cEwT3xF3","vjDJJzSo","eDgdEIR5","KHuDGBZv","cMxXn6jc","k6MIFN5x","urNv28Qs","67aRXMZe","qRQ76Rf0","Zgc9xEVM","BO2q9L5k","pA5bZGgL","hlpWCpdb","VtQ780B7","GPFTSix5","GbfFMHDv","lc9jtbrx","KKxCR20y","Bv2bqjH8","v5QzCYz2","D4RsNyWU","AskCrA18","xPjPWWwA","2kePi0X3","W5GM0HWw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JnrDtPAE/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"W5GM0HWw","project_id":"JnrDtPAE","author_id":"xAJ2OzsA","featured":false,"name":"1.0.3-mc1.21-fabric","version_number":"1.0.3-mc1.21-fabric","changelog":"- 利用 MixinExtras，优化一些 mixin","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-16T07:44:46.233027Z","downloads":393,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e4fc0fd27311d58cc62842732e9a375a6d03c11b71a12a417526ef60c38544eaf4034bbd52ac1c1270ede0e38d047eeedfb15e11e3d0c302322e440f41c48be7","sha1":"eb8c69218c4b9c8a47cf7469b1df6945e4282a08"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JnrDtPAE/versions/W5GM0HWw/brrp-fabric-1.0.3-1.21.jar","filename":"brrp-fabric-1.0.3-1.21.jar","primary":true,"size":195018,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"J8BmWcaG","user":{"id":"xAJ2OzsA","username":"SolidBlock","name":"SolidBlock","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32444848?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-09-02T06:01:33.155586Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"brrp-fabric-1.0.3-1.21.jar"},"mods\\waystones-fabric-1.21-21.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"af0d4a91d663c399103e974d87f9387430433c7d7c943084741421f6aa2c87864858954dc7b5d590935273a27676d531e26ee5a2a1c03ce2e0f9d57ef18a151e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"LOpKHB2A","slug":"waystones","project_type":"mod","team":"cPt0ZaJz","title":"Waystones","description":"Teleport back to activated waystones.

It adds a camera to easily take photos from the client renderer to enable the use of shaders while maintaining compatibility with vanilla clients. To clarify **the mod is required on both server and client sides.** Vanilla clients will still be able to join and see the photos, but will not be able to see or use the added features (which will be displayed as vanilla items), and the items and photos will remain in the world after the mod is removed.\n#\n\n<details>\n<summary>Other recommended camera mods for Fabric</summary>\n\n- [Exposure (made by mortuusars)](https://modrinth.com/mod/exposure) : my favorite camera mod with focus on process and aesthetics. It is required on both server and client sides and adds non-vanilla items that disappear after the mod is uninstalled.\n- [Camera Obscura (made by tomalbrc)](https://modrinth.com/mod/camera-obscura) : a very impressive server-side mod that allows you to take photos on maps that remain after the mod has been uninstalled. No client-side mods required! Everything is rendered on the server using simple raytracing.\n- [Polaroid Camera (made by HyperPigeon)](https://modrinth.com/mod/polaroidcamera) : a very well-made mod that motivated me to try making my own. It lets you take photos on maps that remain after the mod is uninstalled, but adds a non-vanilla camera item that disappears after the mod is uninstalled.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-06-16T09:45:34.688950Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6686375,"followers":5456,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv","7slRrLO6","BkJB5PPB","wmIZ4wP4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"wmIZ4wP4","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":true,"name":"7.0.0 (Fabric)","version_number":"7.0.0","changelog":"- Update to 1.21.0\n- A slight/theoretical improvement of startup performance (embeddedt)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-16T09:45:35.402511Z","downloads":97672,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0f2f9b5aebd71ef3064fc94df964296ac6ee8ea12221098b9df037bdcaaca7bccd473c981795f4d57ff3d49da3ef81f13a42566880b9f11dc64645e9c8ad5d4f","sha1":"95b18b0f1673bbbe328812c3052cc1a921591f0f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/wmIZ4wP4/ferritecore-7.0.0-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-7.0.0-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":117333,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-7.0.0-fabric.jar"},"mods\\sodium-extra-0.5.7+mc1.21.jar":{"sha512":"75a2e73a3cc2fc9556fbd62c9618f1d7455fb1966d993af69133aac5e9dea29dc31b80b61d963857ea4c556a9328634575d81251d782e4eb49ce64e6c60af75c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"PtjYWJkn","slug":"sodium-extra","project_type":"mod","team":"EfhDgRdO","title":"Sodium Extra","description":"A Sodium addon that adds features that shouldn't be in Sodium.","body":"# What is Sodium Extra?\nSodium Extra aims to bring most of OptiFine's eye-candy options to Sodium; in addition to providing some features such as visual bug fixes and other performance options that are not yet available on Sodium.\n\n# Features\nHere is a basic rundown of what this mod does.\n\n- Animations Settings (Control fire, water, lava, block animations and etc...)\n- Particles Settings (Control all types of particles, including ones from other mods)\n- Details Settings (Control sky, stars, sun/moon, weather, and much more)\n- Render Settings (Control fog, static entities, and other miscellaneous renderings)\n- Extra Settings (Display FPS, coordinates, toast notifications, clouds, and much more)\n\nSee a more detailed explanation of what features are included in Sodium Extra [here](https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/wiki/Features).\n\n# Modpack Permissions\nThis is a free and open-source project; you can include it in your mod pack as long as you provide attribution!\n\n# Common Questions\n- **Do I need Sodium installed for this mod to work?** You will need to download Sodium for this mod to work.\n- **Can I re-host/upload this mod somewhere else?** Yes, as long as you provide the mod source code.
